# Flight Delay Prediction

This project aims to predict flight delays using machine learning. By analyzing historical flight data, it builds a deep learning model that estimates the potential arrival delay times and the likelihood of a delay based on various flight features such as air time, distance, and other relevant factors. The model leverages TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning and is evaluated for its performance using multiple metrics. Additionally, it offers real-time predictions, where users can input air time and distance to get an estimate of flight delay.

### Problem Overview:
Flight delays are a common issue in air travel, affecting travelers, airlines, and operations. Predicting these delays accurately can help airlines manage resources efficiently and improve customer satisfaction. This project explores how machine learning models can help predict flight delays, aiding decision-making in real-time.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned, and missing values are handled appropriately. Features like `FlightDate` are converted to datetime objects to extract useful time-related information.
  
- **Visualization**: Exploratory data analysis is performed with visualizations to understand patterns such as average delays by origin and destination airports, correlation among features, and delay trends by month.
  
- **Machine Learning Model**: A deep learning model is built using the Keras library, with a neural network consisting of multiple layers (including dropout for regularization) to predict both the delay time (`ArrDelayMinutes`) and the likelihood of a delay (`is_delay`).
  
- **Real-Time Prediction**: The model allows users to input real-time data (air time and distance) to predict whether a flight will be delayed and by how many minutes.

- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated on various metrics such as accuracy, and model training is performed using historical data to achieve the best possible predictions.

### Tools & Libraries:
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the machine learning model.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework used to build and train the neural network.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization tools used for creating insightful charts such as heatmaps and bar plots.
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualization library used to generate dynamic graphs for better understanding of the data.

### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains historical flight data, including features like:
- **AirTime**: The actual air time in minutes.
- **Distance**: The distance between origin and destination airports.
- **ArrDelayMinutes**: The number of minutes the flight was delayed (if applicable).
- **is_delay**: A binary indicator of whether the flight was delayed (1) or not (0).
- Additional columns include flight-specific details like origin, destination, flight date, etc.

### How the Model Works:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Drop rows with missing values in critical columns (`AirTime`, `Distance`, `ArrDelayMinutes`, `is_delay`).
   - Convert the `FlightDate` column to a datetime object and extract useful time features.
  
2. **Model Architecture**:
   - The neural network model is built with two output layers:
     - **`ArrDelayMinutes`**: A regression output representing the estimated delay in minutes.
     - **`is_delay`**: A binary classification output predicting if a flight will be delayed (1) or not (0).
   - The model uses ReLU activations, Dropout for regularization, and Adam optimizer for efficient training.

3. **Training & Evaluation**:
   - The model is trained on a subset of the data (80%) and evaluated on the remaining 20%.
   - Metrics like accuracy are used to measure the model's performance.

4. **Real-Time Prediction**:
   - After training, the model allows real-time predictions based on user input for air time and distance. This helps users predict the delay time (in minutes) and whether the flight will be delayed.

### How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Load the dataset into your environment and preprocess the data as shown in the code.
4. Train the model by running the script or Jupyter notebook.
5. After training, use the model for real-time predictions by entering air time and distance. The model will predict whether the flight will be delayed and by how many minutes.
6. Optionally, evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy on the test set and visualize various performance metrics.

### Evaluation Results:
- **Accuracy**: Measures how well the model predicts flight delays.
- **Loss**: Evaluates the difference between predicted and actual delay times.
- **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report**: Used to assess the performance of the binary classification task (`is_delay`).

### Future Improvements:
- **Feature Engineering**: Adding more features like weather data or airline-specific data could improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Tuning**: Experimenting with different architectures or models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) could enhance performance.
- **Real-Time Integration**: Integrating real-time flight data sources to provide live predictions.
